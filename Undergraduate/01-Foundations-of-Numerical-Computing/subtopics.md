2. **Number Representation and Floating-Point Arithmetic**
   - Binary and decimal systems
   - How computers store numbers (IEEE 754 basics)
   - Machine epsilon and precision limits
   - Rounding rules

3. **Sources of Error**
   - Truncation error vs. round-off error
   - Absolute and relative error
   - Significant digits

4. **Error Propagation**
   - How errors grow through arithmetic operations
   - Catastrophic cancellation
   - Simple examples of error amplification

5. **Stability and Conditioning**
   - Well-conditioned vs. ill-conditioned problems
   - Stable vs. unstable algorithms
   - Condition number (intuitive introduction)

6. **Big-O Notation and Convergence**
   - Order of approximation
