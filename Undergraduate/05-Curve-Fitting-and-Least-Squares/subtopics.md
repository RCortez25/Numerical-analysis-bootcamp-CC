# Unit 5: Curve Fitting and Least Squares

## Subtopics

1. **The Curve Fitting Problem**
   - Interpolation vs. fitting: why not pass through every point?
   - Noisy data and the need for approximation
   - Overdetermined systems

2. **Least Squares: The Core Idea**
   - Minimizing the sum of squared residuals
   - Geometric intuition: projections
   - Why "squared" and not "absolute value"?

3. **Linear Least Squares**
   - Fitting a straight line (linear regression)
   - The normal equations
   - Solving the normal equations

4. **Polynomial Least Squares**
   - Fitting parabolas and higher-degree polynomials
   - Setting up the system
   - Dangers of overfitting

5. **Linearizable Models**
   - Exponential, power-law, and logarithmic fits
   - Transforming data to use linear least squares
   - Examples from science and engineering

6. **Goodness of Fit**
   - Residual analysis
   - The coefficient of determination (R-squared)
   - When your model is (or isn't) a good fit
