# Unit 6: Numerical Differentiation

## Subtopics

1. **Why Approximate Derivatives?**
   - When the function formula isn't available
   - Data-driven derivatives
   - Setting the stage for differential equations

2. **Finite Difference Formulas**
   - Forward difference
   - Backward difference
   - Central difference
   - Derivation from Taylor series (kept simple)

3. **Accuracy and Step Size**
   - Truncation error of each formula
   - The role of step size h
   - The "sweet spot": balancing truncation and round-off error

4. **Higher-Order Derivatives**
   - Second derivative approximation
   - Finite difference stencils (brief overview)

5. **Richardson Extrapolation**
   - The idea: combining estimates to cancel error
   - A practical technique to improve accuracy
   - Simple example

6. **Pitfalls and Practical Tips**
   - Sensitivity to noise in data
   - Choosing step size in practice
   - Differentiation is inherently ill-conditioned
