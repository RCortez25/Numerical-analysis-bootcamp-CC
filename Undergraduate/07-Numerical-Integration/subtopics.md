# Unit 7: Numerical Integration (Quadrature)

## Subtopics

1. **Why Numerical Integration?**
   - Integrals that have no closed-form solution
   - Integration from data
   - The basic strategy: approximate the area

2. **The Trapezoidal Rule**
   - Geometric idea: approximate with trapezoids
   - Formula for a single interval and composite rule
   - Error analysis (intuitive)

3. **Simpson's Rule**
   - Geometric idea: approximate with parabolas
   - Formula and composite Simpson's rule
   - Why Simpson's is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule

4. **Comparing Quadrature Rules**
   - Degree of exactness
   - Error behavior as we refine the grid
   - Midpoint rule as a bonus

5. **Romberg Integration**
   - Richardson extrapolation applied to integration
   - Building a table of improved estimates
   - A systematic way to get high accuracy

6. **Gaussian Quadrature (Introduction)**
   - The clever idea: choose the nodes optimally
   - Why Gauss quadrature achieves higher accuracy with fewer points
   - Gauss-Legendre quadrature (basic usage, no heavy theory)
